Javascript Functions

	General functions
	Annonymous functions/ function ecpression
	IIFE
	fuction arguments and callback
	arguments.length - n numer of arguments to a function
	functions can be nested
	scope of nested functions is local to their parent/ cannot executed  in outer the parent
	function can return function too / clouser
	inner functions can be assigned to outer functions
	Array elements can be functions too
	Events can be attached to the functions event handlers.
	
	Function.prototype.apply() The apply() method calls a function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array (or an array-like object).
	Function.prototype.bind()  The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value,
	Function.prototype.call()  The call() method calls a function with a given this value and arguments provided individually.
	
	Note: While the syntax of this function is almost identical to that of call(), the fundamental difference is that call() accepts an argument list, 
	while apply() accepts a single array of arguments.

	A function can refer to and call itself. There are three ways for a function to refer to itself:
		the function's name
		arguments.callee
		an in-scope variable that refers to the function

JavaScript Errors - Throw and Try to Catch
	The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.
	The catch statement lets you handle the error.
	The throw statement lets you create custom errors.
	The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.
	
JavaScript Debugging
	The console.log() Method
	The debugger Keyword

JavaScript Hoisting
	Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope
	(to the top of the current script or the current function).
	
JavaScript Use Strict
	The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).
	It is not a statement, but a literal expression, ignored by earlier versions of JavaScript.
	The purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
	With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

	Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.
	Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
	As an example, in normal JavaScript, mistyping a variable name creates a new global variable. 
	In strict mode, this will throw an error, making it impossible to accidentally create a global variable.
	In normal JavaScript, a developer will not receive any error feedback assigning values to non-writable properties.
	In strict mode, any assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property,
	a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object, will throw an error.

	Deleting a function is not allowed.
	Deleting a variable (or object) is not allowed.
	sing a variable, without declaring it, is not allowed:
	Using an object, without declaring it, is not allowed:
	Duplicating a parameter name is not allowed:
	Octal numeric literals are not allowed: var x = 010; 
	ctal escape characters are not allowed: var x = "\010";
	Writing to a read-only property is not allowed:
	Writing to a get-only property is not allowed:
	Deleting an undeletable property is not allowed:
	The string "eval" cannot be used as a variable:
	The string "arguments" cannot be used as a variable:
	The with statement is not allowed:
	In function calls like f(), the this value was the global object. In strict mode, it is now undefined.
	
	Future Proof!
	Future reserved keywords are not allowed in strict mode. These are:
	implements
	interface
	let
	package
	private
	protected
	public
	static
	yield
	
Inheritance with the prototype chain

	Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation someObject.[[Prototype]] is used to designate the prototype of someObject. 
	Since ECMAScript 2015, the [[Prototype]] is accessed using the accessors Object.getPrototypeOf() and Object.setPrototypeOf(). 
	This is equivalent to the JavaScript property __proto__ which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many browsers.
	f.prototype.b = 3;
	var p = Object.create(o);
	One misfeature that is often used is to extend Object.prototype or one of the other built-in prototypes.
	This technique is called monkey patching and breaks encapsulation
	is necessary to use the hasOwnProperty method which all objects inherit from Object.prototype.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	#########################################################################################################################

JavaScript is single threaded and has a synchronous execution model. Single threaded means that one command is being executed at a time. 
Synchronous means one at a time i.e. one line of code is being executed at time in order the code appears. So in JavaScript one thing is happening at a time.

Execution Context

The JavaScript engine interacts with other engines in the browser. In the JavaScript execution stack there is global context at the bottom 
and then when we invoke functions the JavaScript engine creates new execution contexts for respective functions. When the called function 
exits its execution context is popped from the stack, and then next execution context is popped and so on...

For example

function abc()
{
   console.log('abc');
}


function xyz()
{
   abc()
   console.log('xyz');
}
var one = 1;
xyz();
In the above code a global execution context will be created and in this context var one will be stored and its value will be 1...
 when the xyz() invocation is called then a new execution context will be created and if we had defined any variable in xyz 
 function those variables would be stored in the execution context of xyz(). In the xyz function we invoke abc() and then the 
 abc() execution context is created and put on the execution stack... Now when abc() finishes its context is popped from stack,
 then the xyz() context is popped from stack and then global context will be popped...

Now about asynchronous callbacks; asynchronous means more than one at a time.

Just like the execution stack there is the Event Queue. When we want to be notified about some event in the JavaScript engine
 we can listen to that event, and that event is placed on the queue. For example an Ajax request event, or HTTP request event.

Whenever the execution stack is empty, like shown in above code example, the JavaScript engine periodically looks at the event 
queue and sees if there is any event to be notified about. For example in the queue there were two events, an ajax request and 
a HTTP request. It also looks to see if there is a function which needs to be run on that event trigger... So the JavaScript engine 
is notified about the event and knows the respective function to execute on that event... So the JavaScript engine 
invokes the handler function, in the example case, e.g. AjaxHandler() will be invoked and like always when a 
function is invoked its execution context is placed on the execution context and now the function execution finishes 
and the event ajax request is also removed from the event queue... When AjaxHandler() finishes the execution stack is empty 
so the engine again looks at the event queue and runs the event handler function of HTTP request which was next in queue. 
It is important to remember that the event queue is processed only when execution stack is empty.

For example see the code below explaining the execution stack and event queue handling by Javascript engine.

function waitfunction() {
    var a = 5000 + new Date().getTime();
    while (new Date() < a){}
    console.log('waitfunction() context will be popped after this line');
}

function clickHandler() {
    console.log('click event handler...');   
}

document.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);


waitfunction(); //a new context for this function is created and placed on the execution stack
console.log('global context will be popped after this line');
And

<html>
    <head>

    </head>
    <body>

        <script src="program.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
Now run the webpage and click on the page, and see the output on console. The output will be

waitfunction() context will be popped after this line
global context will be emptied after this line
click event handler...
The JavaScript engine is running the code synchronously as explained in the execution context portion, the browser is asynchronously putting things in event
 queue. So the functions which take a very long time to complete can interrupt event handling. Things happening in a browser 
 like events are handled this way by JavaScript, if there is a listener supposed to run, the engine will run it when the execution
 stack is empty. And events are processed in the order they happen, so the asynchronous part is about what is happening outside the engine 
 i.e. what should the engine do when those outside events happen.

So JavaScript is always synchronous.

Synchronous/Asynchronous HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MULTI-THREADING.

Synchronous, or Synchronized means "connected", or "dependent" in some way. In other words, two synchronous tasks must be aware of one another, 
and one task must execute in some way that is dependent on the other, such as wait to start until the other task has completed.
Asynchronous means they are totally independent and neither one must consider the other in any way, either in initiation or in execution.

Synchronous (one thread):

1 thread ->   |<---A---->||<----B---------->||<------C----->|
Synchronous (multi-threaded):

thread A -> |<---A---->|   
                        \  
thread B ------------>   ->|<----B---------->|   
                                              \   
thread C ---------------------------------->   ->|<------C----->| 
Asynchronous (one thread):

         A-Start ------------------------------------------ A-End   
           | B-Start -----------------------------------------|--- B-End   
           |    |      C-Start ------------------- C-End      |      |   
           |    |       |                           |         |      |

Asynchronous (multi-Threaded):

 thread C --------->     |<------C--------->|

Technically, the concept of synchronous/asynchronous really does not have anything to do with threads. Although, in general,
 it is unusual to find asynchronous tasks running on the same thread, it is possible, (see below for examples) and it is common to find
 two or more tasks executing synchronously on separate threads... No, the concept of synchronous/asynchronous has to do solely with whether 
 or not a second or subsequent task can be initiated before the other (first) task has completed, or whether it must wait. That is all.
 What thread (or threads), or processes, or CPUs, or indeed, what hardware, the task[s] are executed on is not relevant. Indeed, 
 to make this point I have edited the graphics to show this.

ASYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE. In solving many engineering problems, the software is designed to split up the overall problem into multiple individual tasks, 
and then execute them asynchronously. Inverting a matrix, or a finite element analysis problem, are good examples. In computing, sorting a list is an 
example. The quick sort routine, for example, splits the list into two lists, and sorts each of them by calling itself recursively. In both of the 
above examples, the two tasks can (and often were) executed asynchronously. They do not need to be on separate threads. Even a machine with one CPU,
 and only one thread of execution can be coded to initiate processing of a second task before a first one has completed. The only criterion is that 
 the results of one task are not necessary as inputs to the other task. As long as the start and end times of the tasks overlap, (possible only if the 
 output of neither is needed as inputs to the other), they are being executed asynchronously, no matter how many threads are in use.

SYNCHRONOUS EXAMPLE. Any process consisting of multiple tasks where the tasks must be executed in sequence, but one must be executed on 
another machine (Fetch and/or update data, get a stock quote from a financial service, etc.). If it's on a separate machine
 it is on a separate thread, whether synchronous or asynchronous.
