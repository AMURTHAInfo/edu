    Yes! its the starting point of 11Km(To and Fro) trek to Belligundi Falls or Kudumari Falls or Chaktikal Falls, it's about 17Km from Shiroor, udupi
	The waterfall is located in a deep forest near a village called Chaktikal under Kundapura taluk of Udupi district in Karnataka. 
	It lies at a distance of about 93 km from the town of Udupi and about 43 km from Murudeshwar. 
	The waterfall has a height of about 600 feet. It involves a trek of about 4 km through the scenic forests of Western Ghats. 
	The trek also involves jumping over rocks of various sizes while proceeding towards the waterfall.
	The waterfall can be accessed by an alternate way too. 
	The bottom of the waterfall can be reached by trekking along the stream from the coastal side. 
	However, this trekking route is an option only during the post monsoon months. 
	This is because the water level recedes during those months and it becomes possible for people to trek through that area.
	But the trek route through the forest is the preferred route by most trekkers.
